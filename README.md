# scent-by-image
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This AI project target is to be able to identify for each main cosmetic scent (such as rose, pine, mint...) several set of images that have together a high probability to conjure the main scent when you see one of these AI-sorted set of images in a picture on a web page.

In this AI project we would use only images to trigger scents. It would not be an application of scent-generating device


## Background

The problem I want to solve is the problem of e-commerce selling products with high olfative charateristics and that do not have currently the way to convey these scents to their customers. I want to be able offer them a list of image proxy for each of the scents they need to convey.

By putting their product inside a composition with the adequate images set, they will be able to summon the right scent memory by trying to use the scent experiences printed in the customer brain and triggered by the set of image.

The categories of products that would benefit of a solution for this problem are : cosmetics, perfumes, cooked dishes, and in fact any product with a scent, or mix of scents, that need to be sold on a e-commerce web site.


## How is it used?

One concrete example : I am selling on a e-commerce website a candle that smells like lemon and pine. How do I maximize the probability to summon the right lemon-pine scent memory when the customer is looking at the picture of my candle?

We could say "put a lemon and a pine" behind your candle on a picture with the three items combined but it is far from satisfying and experience tends to show that a picture with a lemon-pie summon better the memory of lemon scent than the picture of a lemon. So what do I do if I am a e-commerce marketer to promote my lemon and pine candle using images?

Therefore my AI solution would give you the capability to sort any bank of image into adequate subsets that are usually triggering the memory of a set of scents when you are looking at these subsets of images. For example if I have 10 main scents in my products and a bank of 1000 images, I would like to classify my bank in 10 lists, one for each scent. And each list would contain a number of set of images that have a high probability to trigger the scent I am trying to recall.

By using my sorted bank of images, a e-commerce professional would be able to market efficiently its beautifully smelling products on the web by putting them in a picture that usually can generate the right scent memories he wants to generate for each product.

The AI solution I will describe below could be used in theory on any available bank of images for any list of scents.


## Data sources and AI methods

The global methodology I would use is a combination of brain imaging and deep learning.

The steps I am seeing are :
1/ collect :
 - one big bank of images containging simple items (i.e : a lemon, a pine, a rose, a daisy....)
 - one list of main scents that can be easily transported and stored
 - + a brain imaging set + a group of people that are ready to participate to the classification



## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
