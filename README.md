# odour-by-image
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This AI project target is to be able to identify for each main cosmetic odour (such as rose, pine, mint...) several set of images that have together a high probability to conjure the main odour when you see one of these AI-sorted set of images in a picture on a web page.


## Background

The problem I want to solve is the problem of e-commerce selling products with high olfative charateristics and that do not have currently the way to convey these odours to their customers. I want to be able offer them a list of image proxy for each of the odours they need to convey.

By putting their product inside a composition with the adequate images set, they will be able to summon the right odour memory by using the odour experiences printed in the customer brain and triggered by the set of image.

The categories of products that would benefit of a solution for this problem arre : cosmetics, perfumes, cooked dishes, and in fact any product with an odour that need to be sold on a e-commerce web site.


## How is it used?

One concrete example : I am selling on a e-commerce website a candle that smells lemon and pine. How do I maximize the probability to summon the right lemon-pine odour memory when the customer is looking at the picture of my candle?

We could say put a lemon and a pine behind your candle but it is far from satisfying and experience tends to show that a picture with a lemon-pie summon better the memory of lemon odour than the picture of a lemon. So what do I do if I am a e-commerce marketer to promote my lemon and pine candle using images?

Therefore muy AI solution would give you the capability to sort any bank of image in adequate subsets that are triggering the memory of a set of odours when you are looking at these subsets of images. For example if I have 10 main odours in my products and a bank of 1000 images, I would like to classify my bank in 10 lists, one for each odour.
And each list would contain a number of set of images that have a high probability to trigger the odour I am trying to recall.

By using my sorted bank, I would be able to market efficiently my product on the web but putting it in a picture that can generate the right odour memories I want to generate.

The AI solution I will describe below could be used in theory on any available bank of images for any list of odours.


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
